# my first decorator written in python!
## task: A common real-world use for decorators is measuring how long a function takes to run. We call this benchmarking. 

### Your goal is to create a decorator named @time_it that:

   - Records the time before the function starts.  
   - Runs the function.
   - Records the time after it finishes.
   - Prints the difference (the duration).
  
### Obtained result:
```bash
sergiu decorator $ python3 decorator.py
time for f(): letsgoo   0:00:00.000007
time for g(): 0:00:00.001276
time for h(): 0:00:01.283157
```
